# Marketing Site for Noise Controller App

This is a landing site built by Dave Irwin and currently [live here](https://noisecontroller.netlify.com/index.html). Its purpose is to promote the Noise Controller app built by Dave's Lambda School sprint team and link to the app. As one of two User Interface developers building their own marketing sites, Dave built this site from scratch to represent his own skills while contributing to the overall project.

## Technologies Used for This Marketing Site

This site uses HTML5, CSS3, LESS, and JavaScript. The [About page](https://noisecontroller.netlify.com/about.html) uses a JavaScript module Dave created to display only the team member cards matching the menu item selected. Git version control was used throughout the build.

## About the Noise Controller App

The [Noise Controller app](https://noiselistener-app.netlify.com/) is intended for teachers of younger children who are looking for ways to keep the student noise level down in their classrooms. The app listens for and responds to noise levels with animal sounds and on-screen actions. If students are too loud, the animals may be scared away. The longer students can maintain a specified noise level, the more animals they can collect and interact with. Teachers can set the sensitivity level as needed, set up multiple classes if they teach several groups, and save status to pick up where the class left off previously.
