# About the Noise Controller App

The [Noise Controller App](https://noiselistener-app.netlify.com/) is intended for teachers of younger children who are looking for ways to keep the student noise level down in their classrooms. The app listens for and responds to noise levels with animal sounds and on-screen actions. If students are too loud, the animals may be scared away. The longer students can maintain a specified noise level, the more animals they can collect and interact with. Teachers can set the sensitivity level as needed, set up multiple classes if they teach several groups, and save status to pick up where the class left off previously.

## About this Marketing Site

This is one landing site built to market a front-end app created by our sprint team at Lambda School. As one of two User Interface developers building their own marketing sites, I build this site from scratch to represent my own skills while contributing to the overall project.

## Technologies Used for This Marketing Site

This site uses HTML5, CSS3, LESS, and JavaScript. The about page uses a JavaScript module I created to present only the team member cards matching the menu item selected. Git version control was used throughout the build.
